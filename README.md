# ScooterPy

## Description
`ScooterPy` is a Python script designed to assist in the analysis and optimization of electric scooters. This library provides a set of functions to calculate various parameters critical to the performance and maintenance of electric scooters.

## Features
- **Field Weakening Flux Calculation:** Calculate the field weakening flux based on the current speed and other parameters.
- **Battery Charge Percentage Calculation:** Determine the charge percentage of a battery based on its voltage and the number of cells.
- **Maximum Battery Voltage Calculation:** Calculate the maximum battery voltage from the Radc value.
- **Shunt Resistor Calculation:** Compute the shunt resistor value for a desired current.

## Installation
To use `ScooterPy`, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lekrsu/ScooterPy.git
cd ScooterPy
python calc.py
```

## Usage
Run the main program and follow the on-screen prompts to select a calculation and enter the necessary parameters.
